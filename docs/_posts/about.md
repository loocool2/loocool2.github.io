Hi, I'm loo, currently a Sophomore in college studying Computer Science! I've always loved playing with computers as a kid and getting around my parent's virtual barriers, so here I am now.

I picked up this hobby this summer, and it's led me down a long, fascinating rabbit hole. Right now I'm stumbling through everything and I'll try to chronicle my experiences down the hole!
